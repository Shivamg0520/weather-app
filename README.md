# 🌦️ Weather App (API Practice)

This is a simple **Python-based Weather App** created while learning **API integration**.  
It fetches real-time weather information of any city using the **[WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches **real-time weather data** for any city.
- Displays details like city, region, country, temperature, condition, wind speed, humidity, and feels-like temperature.
- Demonstrates **API calling**, **JSON handling**, and **error management** in Python.
- Great for beginners learning to work with APIs.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Requests** (for API calls)

## ⚙️ How to Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Get your **API key** from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).  
   Replace `"API-KEY"` in `weather_app.py` with your actual key.

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python weather_app.py
   ```

5. Enter any city name when prompted, for example:
   ```bash
   Enter city name: Delhi
   ```
